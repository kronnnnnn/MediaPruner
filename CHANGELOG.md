All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-12-20

### Added
- Implemented the new Queue subsystem (backend + frontend): async queue tasks with SSE updates and HTTP snapshot fallback. This includes API endpoints for creating and managing tasks and a frontend UI for viewing tasks and progress.
- Database initialization steps to normalize legacy `media_type` and queue `status` values during startup.

### Fixed
- Resolved merge conflicts and removed leftover merge artifacts introduced during the `implement-queue` rebase.
- Fixed TMDB search fallback behavior and updated tests to use `ASGITransport` with `httpx.AsyncClient`.

### Changed
- Unified event handling in `QueueContext` (SSE + HTTP fallback) and improved reconnection logic.
- Various test fixes and cleanup; backend tests pass locally.
