Release notes — 2025-12-20

Summary:
- The `implement-queue` feature has been rebased onto `main` and merged. This release introduces a background Queue subsystem for long-running tasks (refresh metadata, analyze, etc.).

Highlights:
- Backend
  - New `Queue` models, services, and router endpoints for task creation, status updates, cancellation, and SSE streaming.
  - DB migration and normalization to prevent Enum lookup issues for legacy values.
  - Worker logic to process queued tasks (e.g., metadata refresh, analyze, sync watch history).
- Frontend
  - `QueueContext` provides real-time updates via SSE with an HTTP snapshot fallback to avoid missing initial state.
  - `Queues` UI page to view all tasks, progress, and details.
- Tests & CI
  - Fixed test cases and removed merge artifacts; backend test suite runs clean locally.

Notes for reviewers:
- CI should be re-run to ensure the remote environment picks up the rebased commits correctly.
- If you prefer a release tag, we can create a `vX.Y.Z` tag after CI is green.

Acknowledgements:
- Thanks to the contributors who resolved the conflicts and performed test-driven fixes.
