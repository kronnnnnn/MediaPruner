Git branching & workflow

This project follows a simplified GitFlow-inspired process to keep work organized and stable.

Branches
- main: production-ready code. Only merge here after features/release testing and passing CI.
- develop: integration branch for completed features. Feature branches are branched off `develop`.
- feature/*: short-lived branches for new features or improvements. Example: `feature/queue-sse`.
- release/*: optional branches for preparing a release from `develop` to `main`.
- hotfix/*: immediate fixes branched from `main` and merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

Conventions
- Branch names: use lowercase and slashes, e.g., `feature/brief-description`.
- PRs: target `develop` for feature PRs; target `main` for release/hotfix PRs.
- Tests & CI: run tests and linters locally; CI must pass before merging.
- Commit messages: use `type(scope): message` style (e.g., `fix(queue): resolve tmdb search fallback`).

Suggested protections & CI
- Protect `main` with required reviews and passing CI checks.
- Optionally protect `develop` to require CI and at least one approving review before merging.

Getting started
1. Create a feature branch:
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature develop
2. Make commits, push, and open a PR targeting `develop`.
3. After review & CI, merge into `develop`.
4. When ready for a release, create `release/x.y.z` from `develop`, test, then merge into `main`.

Notes
- We currently have only `main` and `develop` branches; feature branches should be created from `develop` going forward.

Enforcement (GitFlow strict)
- The repository **default branch will be `develop`** so new PRs target `develop` by default.
- All feature work MUST be opened as PRs targeting `develop` and must pass CI and peer review before merging.
- Releases are prepared from `develop` via `release/*` branches and merged into `main` for production deployment.
- Automated approvals: We run a bot workflow that will auto-approve PRs as **"GPT-5-mini"** when the `CI` workflow completes successfully. This lets you merge your own PRs after CI passes while keeping branch protections strict.
